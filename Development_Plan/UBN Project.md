## Phase 1: Initial Setup
**Objective:** Establish the foundational structure and tools necessary for development and documentation.
### 1. Project Initialization
- Create the UBN solution in Visual Studio 2022. - Set up the project directory for documentation.
### 2. Version Control Setup
- Initialize a Git repository for the project. - Push the initial project structure to GitHub.
### 3. Documentation
- Create the following initial markdown files:
- `ProjectOverview/Overview.md`
- `DevelopmentPlan/Plan.md`
- `Components/SDL/SDL.md`
- `Components/Vulkan/Vulkan.md`
- `Components/ImGui/ImGui.md`
- `Components/FFmpeg/FFmpeg.md`
- `LearningResources/Resources.md`
- `AgentInstructions/Development.md`
- `AgentInstructions/GitHub.md`
- `AgentInstructions/Application.md`
- `AgentInstructions/Premake.md`
- `AgentInstructions/SDL.md`
## Phase 2: Core Components Integration
**Objective:**
Set up the core components required for the project, including window management, input handling, and rendering.
### 1. Window Management and Input Handling (SDL2)
- Integrate SDL2 into the project.
- Ensure proper configuration with Premake.
- Document the setup process in `Components/SDL/SDL.md`.
### 2. Graphics Rendering (Vulkan)
- Set up Vulkan for graphics rendering.
- Ensure compatibility with SDL2.
- Document the setup process in `Components/Vulkan/Vulkan.md`.
### 3. User Interface (ImGui)
- Integrate ImGui for the user interface.
- Ensure it works seamlessly with Vulkan.
- Document the setup process in `Components/ImGui/ImGui.md`.
## Phase 3: Advanced Features Implementation
**Objective:**
Implement advanced features such as video processing, real-time interaction tools, and personalized learning paths.
### 1. Video Processing (FFmpeg)
- Integrate FFmpeg for video handling.
- Ensure compatibility with the existing setup.
- Document the setup process in `Components/FFmpeg/FFmpeg.md`.
### 2. Real-Time Interaction Tools
- Develop tools for real-time Q&A, polls, and discussions.
- Integrate these tools with the main application.
- Document the implementation process in `Application/RealTimeInteraction.md`.
### 3. Personalized Learning Paths and Analytics
- Implement adaptive learning paths based on user performance.
- Develop analytics tools to track user progress and engagement.
- Document the implementation process in `Application/PersonalizedLearning.md`.
## Phase 4: Testing and Deployment
**Objective:**
Test the application across multiple platforms and prepare it for deployment.
### 1. Cross-Platform Testing
Test the application on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- Identify and fix platform-specific issues.
- Document the testing process and findings in `Testing/CrossPlatformTesting.md`.
### 2. Optimization
- Optimize the application for performance and scalability.
- Ensure efficient use of resources across different hardware setups.
- Document optimization techniques in `Development/Optimization.md`.
### 3. Deployment Preparation
- Prepare the application for deployment.
- Create deployment scripts and ensure smooth installation processes.
- Document the deployment process in `Deployment/DeploymentGuide.md`.
## Phase 5: Continuous Learning and Documentation 
**Objective:**
Ensure ongoing learning and maintain comprehensive documentation throughout the project lifecycle.
### 1. Learning and Development
- Continuously update the `LearningResources/Resources.md` file with new findings and resources.
- Encourage documenting new learnings and insights regularly.
### 2. Documentation Maintenance
- Regularly update all markdown files with the latest information.
- Ensure documentation is clear, comprehensive, and up-to-date.
### 3. Project Management and Review
- Use the `AgentInstructions/Development.md` file to guide the Development agent in overseeing the project.
- Regularly review and refine the development plan as needed.
